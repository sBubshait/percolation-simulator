# Percolation Simulator ðŸ§ª
Estimate Percolation Thresholds using Monte Carlo Simulations in Java!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Percolation Simulator! ðŸš€ This project uses the Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression algorithm to estimate percolation thresholds.

## Percolation Examples

Here are two examples of percolation simulations:

**Percolation Example 1: Percolates**

**Percolation Example 2: Does Not Percolate**

## Usage

To simulate a single percolation, you'll want to use `Percolation.java`. Make sure you've compiled the file and then execute it.

If you're aiming to estimate percolation thresholds across multiple trials, follow these steps:

1. Compile `PercolationSimulator.java`.
2. Run the compiled program with two arguments:
   - The length of one side of the grid (n x n grid).
   - The number of trials to be executed.

Example command: `java PercolationSimulator 50 200`
